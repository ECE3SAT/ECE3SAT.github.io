      <description>ADCS This year corresponds the B phase of the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) of the ECE3SAT. Our work will be centralized on 4 fields.
First of all, we want our satellite to be as open source as possible, that&amp;rsquo;s why we are going to develop our visibility and to document all our work through the year. That means we are going to be much more present on social media, post videos, communicateâ€¦</description>

      <description>The payload was developed in parallel of the 4 modules:
 On Board Computer (OBC) Energy Power Supply (EPS) Attitude Determination Control System (ADCS) Telecommunication System (TCS)  The goal of the payload is to test in practice a physical theory who was validated as a new deorbiting system.The launch is scheduled for the end of 2021. If the mission is a success this can lead to great progress on larger satellites.</description>
