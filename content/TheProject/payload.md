The payload was developed in parallel of the 4 modules:

- Energy Power Supply ([EPS]({{< relref "CubesatModules/eps.md" >}}))
- Telecommunication System ([TCS]({{< relref "CubesatModules/tcs.md" >}}))
- Attitude Determination Control System ([ADCS]({{< relref "CubesatModules/adcs.md" >}}))
- OnBoard Computer ([OBC]({{< relref "CubesatModules/obc.md" >}}))

The goal of the payload is to test in practice a physical theory who was
validated as a new deorbiting system.The launch is scheduled for the end
of 2021. If the mission is a success this can lead to great progress on
larger satellites.
