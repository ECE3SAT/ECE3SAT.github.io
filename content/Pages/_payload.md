The payload was developed in parallel of the 4 modules:

- On Board Computer ([OBC](/wiki/obc/index.html))
- Energy Power Supply ([EPS](/wiki/eps/index.html))
- Attitude Determination Control System ([ADCS](/wiki/adcs/index.html))
- Telecommunication System ([TCS](/wiki/tcs/index.html))

The goal of the payload is to test in practice a physical theory who was
validated as a new deorbiting system.The launch is scheduled for the end
of 2021. If the mission is a success this can lead to great progress on
larger satellites.
